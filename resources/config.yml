VERSION: "1.0.0" # Internal use only

# These are the settings that determine which worlds beacons can be created in
Worlds:

  # This is the list of worlds which worlds to include/exclude RGBeacon creation
  List:
    - "Lobby"
    - "Spawn"

  # Choose the mode for the world list, options are blacklist, whitelist, or false
  # Set this to false to enable RGBeacons in all worlds
  Mode: false

# Choose whether to set the beacon's color with a stained glass block or a stained glass pane
# Options are block or pane
Color-Type: "block"

# Set the beacon refresh task delay in ticks
# This is to fix beacon beam updating when chunks unload and are loaded again
# Plugin default is 300 ticks (15 seconds)
# Set this to false if you don't want the beacon to update cyclically
Beacon-Refresh-Delay: 300

# These are the beacon defaults that are used when creating a beacon
Defaults:

  # Set the default beacon color duration
  # Beacon beams update every 80 ticks (4 seconds)
  # Plugin default is 80
  Delay: 80

  # Set the default beacon colors
  # Available olors: white, red, orange, pink, yellow, lime, green, light blue, cyan, blue, magenta, purple, brown, gray, light gray, black
  # Plugin default is white
  Colors:
    - white

# This is where beacon data is stored
# Any number of colors can be added to a beacon
# Refrain from directly editing this for the sake of creating loads of errors

Beacons: []

# Key:
# ID → Beacon's world ID set by the plugin when executing `/beacon new`
# Level → World the beacon is placed on
# Coords → XYZ coordinates of the beacon's loaction in the world
# Delay → How many ticks between color changes; 1 second = 20 ticks
# Replaced → This is the ID of the two blocks the beacon replaced, needed for removal
# Base → All 9 blocks occupied by the base of the beacon, needed for removal
# Colors → List of colors the beacon should change to

# Beacon format is as follows:
# ID:
#   Level: "Name"
#   Coords: [x,y,z]
#   Delay: ticks
#   Replaced:
#     Glass: "ID:Meta"
#     Beacon: "ID:Meta"
#   Base: [
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#     "ID:Meta",
#   ]
